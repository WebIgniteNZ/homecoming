        Juicy Fest aims to ensure all attendees have an enjoyable experience and want to provide
        equal opportunity for our festival fans with disabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a continued effort to make sure Juicy Fest is accessible for all we accept official
        &apos;Companion Cards&apos;, enabling entry to people with disabilities who can&apos;t
        access ticketed events and venues without a support person.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person with a disability attending Juicy Fest will need to purchase a ticket to the show
        of their choice.

      <p>
        {" "}
        On event day, that ticket holder and their support person will need to present to the Box
        Office, where staff will verify the &apos;Companion Card&apos; and identification of the
        holder of the &apos;Companion Card&apos;.
