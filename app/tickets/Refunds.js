        Unfortunately, Juicy Fest has a strict no refund policy. However, if for any reason you can
        no longer attend the Juicy Fest show your ticket has been purchased for, you can on-sell
        your ticket on the resale ticket platform . . .{" "}

        We recommend only using this platform to resell your unallocated Juicy Fest ticket to
        protect both the seller and purchaser.
